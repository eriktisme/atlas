# Monitoring

## Overview

Atlas operates in multiple AWS regions, each with its own set of monitoring dashboards and alerts.

### Regional Monitoring

Each AWS region has a dedicated monitoring dashboard that provides insights into the health and performance of services running in that region. 
These dashboards include metrics such as error rates, latency and throughput.
